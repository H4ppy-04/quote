                                     USAGE


SYNOPSIS

    parser [--color <always | auto | never>] [-V | --version] ...


OPTIONS

    --color <always | auto | never>

      (When supported) use 8-base colors for more colorful output.
      This is not fully integrated yet, as logging is still being worked on.

    --verbose 

      Print additional debug messages. Useful for debugging or submitting traceback logs.

    -V | --version

      Print the current version. This interfaces with Git, and requires Git to be installed and .git to be present.

COMMANDS

    qotd (quote of the day)

      Print the quote of the day! This simply indexes a random quote from the quote list. Note that if the --verbose argument is specified
      and no quote is found, then this will be conveyed via a log message.

    query <[--author <name>] | [--id <id>]> [--show-duplicates]

      Get a specific quote by specifying its ID or get multiple quotes that are written by a specific author.
      Duplicate quotes (quotes that have the same content - regardless of their author) can be shown as well with --show-duplicates.
      The query command must be used with either the `author` or `id` arguments. It cannot be used on its own without positional arguments.
      By default, the identifier is the primary trait used to index a quote; if invalid or unspecified, the author is used instead. 

    add [ --author <name> ] <quote>
      
      Add a quote to a list of quotes (in its relative json file).
      The author field is optional, but if one isn't provided the author
      will simply be listed as "Anonymous".

    prune [--verbose]

      Detect and remove duplicate quotes (as defined in the query command). Quote ID's will be reordered so that there are no gaps.
      If the --verbose argument is specified, quote ID's and deletion events will be shown.

    update [--verbose] [--force] [--check-dev]

      Fetch and integrate any new changes from the remote Git repository (1).
      Executing the update command requires a valid git installation.
