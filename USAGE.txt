                                     USAGE


SYNOPSIS

    parser [--color <always | auto | never>] [-V | --version] ...


OPTIONS

    --color <always | auto | never>

      (When supported) use 8-base colors for more colorful output.
      This is not fully integrated yet, as logging is still being worked on.

    -V | --version

      Print the current version. This interfaces with Git, and requires Git to be installed.


COMMANDS

    query <[--author <name>] | [--id <id>]> [--show-duplicates]

      Get a specific quote by specifying its ID or get multiple quotes that are written by a specific author.
      Duplicate quotes (quotes that have the same content - regardless of their author) can be shown as well with --show-duplicates.
      The query command must be used with either the `author` or `id` arguments. It cannot be used on its own without positional arguments.

    add [ --author <name> ] <quote>
      
      Add a quote to a list of quotes (in its relative json file).
      The author field is optional, but if one isn't provided the author
      will simply be listed as "Anonymous".

    prune [--verbose]

      Detect and remove duplicate quotes (as defined in the query command). Quote ID's will be reordered so that there are no gaps.
      If the --verbose argument is specified, quote ID's and deletion events will be shown.

    update [--verbose] [--force] [--check-dev]

      Fetch and integrate any new changes from the remote Git repository (1).
